# Terraform modules for k0s OS testing

Provisioning of k0s test clusters using different operating system stacks and
network providers based on Terraform and k0sctl.

By default, a test cluster will consist of

* 3 controller nodes
* 2 worker nodes
* Node-local load balancing is enabled.
* All the rest of the configuration is left at its defaults.

Two workers are a minimum requirement for the Kubernetes conformance tests.

## Requirements

* [Terraform] >= 1.4

For the local plumbing:

* A POSIXish environment (`env`, `sh`, `echo`, `printf`)
* [k0sctl] (tested with ~= 0.15)
* [jq] (tested with ~= 1.6)

For the AWS infra:

* Have the CLI credentials setup, in the usual AWS CLI way.
* Have a configured default region. That region will be targeted by Terraform.

## Deploying a cluster

Be sure to meet the requisites listed above. Configure AWS credentials and
region. This is just an example, there are [other ways][aws-config] to do it.

```shell
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=...
export AWS_REGION=...
```

Select the desired cluster configuration for Terraform. Again, just an example,
other ways described [here][tf-config].

```shell
export TF_VAR_os=alpine_3_17
export TF_VAR_k0s_network_provider=calico
```

[aws-config]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html
[tf-config]: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#assigning-values-to-root-module-variables

Apply the configuration:

```shell
terraform apply
```

## Terraform configuration variables

### `os`: Operating system stack

* `alpine_3_17`: Alpine Linux 3.17
* `centos_7`: CentOS Linux 7 (Core)
* `centos_8`: CentOS Stream 8
* `centos_9`: CentOS Stream 9
* `debian_10`: Debian GNU/Linux 10 (buster)
* `debian_11`: Debian GNU/Linux 11 (bullseye)
* `fcos_38`: Fedora CoreOS 38
* `fedora_38`: Fedora Linux 38 (Cloud Edition)
* `flatcar`: Flatcar Container Linux by Kinvolk
* `oracle_7_9`: Oracle Linux Server 7.9
* `oracle_8_7`: Oracle Linux Server 8.7
* `oracle_9_1`: Oracle Linux Server 9.1
* `rhel_7`: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.9 (Maipo)
* `rhel_8`: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 (Ootpa)
* `rhel_9`: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 (Plow)
* `rocky_8`: Rocky Linux 8.7 (Green Obsidian)
* `rocky_9`: Rocky Linux 9.2 (Blue Onyx)
* `ubuntu_2004`: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
* `ubuntu_2204`: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
* `ubuntu_2304`: Ubuntu 23.04

### `k0s_version`: The k0s version to deploy

This may be a fixed version number, "stable" or "latest".

### `k0s_network_provider`: Network provider

* `kuberouter`
* `calico`

### Adding a new operating system

* Navigate to [modules/os/](modules/os/) and add a new file `os_<the-os-id>.tf`.
  Have a look at the other `os_*.tf` files for how it should look like.
* Add a new OS entry to [modules/os/main.tf](modules/os/main.tf).
* Update this README.
* Test it: Be sure to have the requisites ready, as described at the top of this
  README, then do `terraform apply -var=os=<the-os-id>`. When done, don't
  forget to clean up: `terraform destroy -var=os=<the-os-id>`.
* Update the [nightly trigger] and [matrix workflow] with the new OS ID.

## GitHub Actions workflows

There's a reusable GitHub Actions workflow available in [ostests-e2e.yaml]. It
will deploy the Terraform resources and perform Kubernetes conformance tests
against the provisioned test cluster.

[ostests-e2e.yaml]: ../../.github/workflows/ostests-e2e.yaml

### Launch a workflow run

There's a [nightly trigger] for the OS testing workflow. It will select and run
a single testing parameter combination each day. There's also a [matrix
workflow] that exposes more knobs and can be triggered manually, e.g. via [gh]:

```console
$ gh workflow run ostests-matrix.yaml --ref some/experimental/branch \
  -f oses='["alpine_3_17"]' \
  -f network-providers='["calico"]'
âœ“ Created workflow_dispatch event for ostests-matrix.yaml at some/experimental/branch

To see runs for this workflow, try: gh run list --workflow=ostests-matrix.yaml
```

[gh]: https://github.com/cli/cli

## TODO

* Figure out the best/canonical way to change host names of the AWS instances

[nightly trigger]: ../../.github/workflows/ostests-nightly.yaml
[matrix workflow]: ../../.github/workflows/ostests-matrix.yaml
