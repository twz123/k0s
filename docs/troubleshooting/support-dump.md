# Support Insight

In many cases, especially when looking for [commercial support](../commercial-support.md) there's a need for share the cluster state with other people.
While one could always give access to the live cluster that is not always desired nor even possible.

For those kind of cases we can lean on the work our friends at [troubleshoot.sh](https://troubleshoot.sh) have done.

With troubleshoot tool you can essentially take a dump of the cluster state and share it with other people. You can even use [sbctl](https://github.com/replicatedhq/sbctl) tool to make the dump tarball to act as Kubernetes API.

Let's look at how this works with k0s.

## Setting up

To gather all the needed data we need another tool called [`support-bundle`](https://troubleshoot.sh/docs/support-bundle/introduction/).

You can download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/replicatedhq/troubleshoot/releases), pay attention that you download the right architecture.

## Creating support bundle

A Support Bundle needs to know what to collect and optionally, what to analyze. This is defined in a YAML file.

While you can customize the data collection and analysis for your specific needs, we've made a good reference for k0s. These cover the core k0s things like:

- collecting info on the host
- collecting system component statuses from `kube-system` namespace
- checking health of Kubernetes API, Etcd etc. components
- collecting k0s logs
- checking status of firewalls, anti-virus etc. services which are known to interfere with Kubernetes

As we need to collect host level info you should run the commands on the hosts directly, on controllers and/or workers.

To get a support bundle, after setting up the [tooling](#setting-up), you simply run:

```shell
support-bundle --kubeconfig /var/lib/k0s/pki/admin.conf https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/support-bundle-<role>.yaml
```

Above `<role>` refers to either `controller`or `worker`. For different roles we collect different things. If you are running a controller with `--enable-worker` or `--single`, where it becomes also a worker, you can also get a combined dump:

```shell
support-bundle --kubeconfig /var/lib/k0s/pki/admin.conf https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/support-bundle-controller.yaml https://docs.k0sproject.io/stable/support-bundle-worker.yaml
```

Once the data collection and analysis finishes you will get a file called like `support-bundle-<timestamp>.tar.gz`. The file contains all the collected info which you can share with other people.
